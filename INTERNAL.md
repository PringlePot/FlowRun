- d3-graphviz (works pretty good) -> problems with overlapping edges

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5343899/how-to-force-node-position-x-and-y-in-graphviz




Tried and failed approaches:
- cytoscape-dagre -> problems with cyclic graphs
- flowchartjs ->
    - cant add metadata to edges, which is needed when inserting new node etc.
    - cant use direct recursion, eg. empty while loop
- mxgraph -> I forgot what was the issue, layout maybe
